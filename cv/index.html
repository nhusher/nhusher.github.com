    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I've been designing and building user interfaces since 2007. My career
      has been characterized by building and maintaining complex front-end
      applications alongside many contributors. My computer science education
      allows me contribute to backend development and aid in business logic and
      data model design.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm an expert in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, including leading edge
      features and standards like Promises and ES6. I have experience in
      human-computer interaction design and UI best-practices. I am 
      self-directed, enthusiastic about independent learning, and have
      excellent problem-solving skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm a functional programming enthusiast; I beleive it makes software more
      reliable, easier to understand, and easier to change. It tends to also
      result in far less code; fewer lines written means fewer bugs means faster
      development velocity.

            Pwnie Express provides vulnerability and threat detection software.
            They use custom-designed sensors to detect devices connected to a
            network and wireless devices that are adjacent to the network like
            cell phones, bluetooth devices, wireless printers, or credit card
            skimmers. These devices are categorized and indexed, and can be 
            navigated using their web application.

            My job is threefold: I work with other developers to implement new
            features that our users and prospective clients want, and will drive
            engagement on the platform; I lead an application-wide effort to 
            migrate the project from a legacy Ember implementation to on written
            in React, with more modern and functional sensibilities; An finally,
            I provide user experience leadership in an environment where there
            are many talented engineers, support reps, and salespeople, but no
            designers.

          <p>
            Faraday provides machine-learning driven prospecting and marketing
            tools that strive for customer recruitment rather than untargeted
            email blasts. The company focuses on connecting companies that are
            selling big-ticket "dinner table" items with interested families.
            Example verticals are rooftop solar, high-end furniture, vacations,
            health and wellness, and home improvement. The simple-to-use
            interface lets a marketer slice and dice their market by many
            demographic criteria&mdash;it takes about 20 minutes to go from
            exploring a potential market to downloading a list. Compareed to the
            'mystery meat' experience of buying a list from an ad agency, 
            Faraday is an enormous improvement.
          </p>
          <p>
            My role at Faraday was fluid: Truly in early-stage startup mode, the
            company required that I wear several hats. Some of my job was to 
            support our customer customer success team in ensuring our clients 
            were happy and understood our application; other times, I would be
            implementing new features, or pushing an unruly app into a docker 
            container. The major engineering efforts I led was: convering a 
            proof-of-concept Angular app to React and Redux, which greatly 
            increased developer productivity and allows for quick changes in 
            direction when we learned new things about our customers' needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            I continue to work for Faraday in off-hours on a consultancy basis:
            I enjoy working with the team, I believe in the product, and I have
            good feelings and ownership over the codebase.

            Dealer.com provides software as a service for car dealerships. Their
            primary offering is dynamic website design, powered by rules-based
            inventory pricing and A/B testing. They were acquired by DealerTrack
            in 2014, which was subsequently acquired by Cox Automotive in 2015.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was one of four founding members of a team tasked with building
            the best-possible automotive CRM system, implemented in enterprise
            Java, Groovy, and Grails. I worked with industry experts to solve
            complex user experience problems. I implemented a single-page app\
            framework in YUI3 a year before SPA frameworks really existed. I
            also spent some time working in the backend, helping connect the CRM
            to a data warehouse system written in Hadoop. Before departing in
            2015, I also helped lay down the cornerstones of a new "common
            container" project that sought to unify the UI codebases of many
            Dealer.com and Dealertrack properties into something more
            consistent, usable, and performant.

            needed to meet a deadline or satisfiy a client.
