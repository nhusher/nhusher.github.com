    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I've been designing and building user interfaces since 2007. My career
      has been defined by building and maintaining complex front-end
      applications alongside many contributors. I also can bring my computer
      science education to bear on backend development, aiding in business
      logic, infrastructure, and data model design. I'm a polyglot developer: I
      appreciate the opportunity to experiment with new languages and
      approaches.

            Faraday provides AI-driven data science for companies that can't or
            don't want to set up their own in-house data science group. They use
            a flexible infrastructure to apply artificial intelligence to
            different business problems, from generating marketing lists to
            recommending the locations of new storefronts.

            As a small startup looking for a niche in the market, my role is
            multifaceted. My main responsibility is improving their self-service
            market analysis web application. I'm also involved in database
            design discussions, data security, and continuous integration.

            Lola Travel is a startup that is building lightweight, user-focused
            travel software for small businesses.
          </p>
          <p>
            My role was to provide technical leadership and support on three 
            React-based projects: A React Native mobile app that can be used to
            book hotels and flights, a React web application that travel 
            administrators within a company may use to track and manage
            business trips that employees have booked, and a web application
            that Lola agents use to provide support to the other two apps,
            served by a graphql endpoint.

            Pwnie Express provides vulnerability and threat detection software.
            They use custom-designed sensors to detect devices connected to a
            network and wireless devices that are adjacent to the network like
            cell phones, bluetooth devices, wireless printers, or credit card
            skimmers. These devices are categorized and indexed, and can be 
            investigated using their web application.
          </p>
          <p>
            My job was threefold: I worked with other developers to implement
            new features that users and prospective clients want, that would
            drive engagement on the platform; I lead an application-wide effort
            to migrate the project from a legacy Ember implementation to one
            written in React, with more modern and functional sensibilities;
            And finally, I provided user experience leadership in an
            environment where there were many talented engineers, support
            reps, and salespeople, but no designers.

            Dealer.com provides software as a service for car dealerships. Their
            primary offering is dynamic website design, powered by rules-based
            inventory pricing and A/B testing. They were acquired by DealerTrack
            in 2014, which was subsequently acquired by Cox Automotive in 2015.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was one of four founding members of a team tasked with building
            the best-possible automotive CRM system, implemented in enterprise
            Java, Groovy, and Grails. I worked with industry experts to solve
            complex user experience problems, and worked to connect the backend
            of the CRM to the company's Hadoop-based analytics solution. I also
            helped lay down the cornerstones of a new "common container"
            project that sought to unify the UI codebases of many Dealer.com
            and Dealertrack properties into something more consistent, usable,
            and performant.
